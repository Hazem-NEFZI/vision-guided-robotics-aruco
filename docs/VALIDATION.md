# Validation record — 7 November 2026

## Executed locally

Python 3.12.14, Linux x86-64, CPU execution. Core tests plus available optional app/neural tests:

The suite includes success paths and malformed inputs. It does not prove absence of bugs. Static lint and format checks were run. Multi-version GitHub Actions is configured but has not run on GitHub as part of this task. Windows, CUDA, real robots and external pretrained SAM were not tested.

## Reproduced demonstrations

- `python -m robotics_vision.demo --output outputs/demo`: exit 0.

Machine-readable sample results are in `assets/`. All included benchmark inputs were synthetic. Real-data folder and image-pair workflows were smoke-tested with generated fixtures, not public industrial benchmarks.
